# WSL2-pass

Add WSL2 clipboard support to `pass` by calling Powershell Win32 process.
During install, WSL environment is detected by looking for the existance of the `WSLENV` env.
Make sure to preserve your current environment with the `-E` option of `sudo`, otherwise WSL2 custom clip function won't be provisioned.

```
sudo -E make install 
```

======================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Visit the project page for more information: http://www.passwordstore.org/

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.
